# Hi there! üíôüíõ

I'm Olena, a passionate UI/UX designer turned developer based in Spain. Welcome to my GitHub profile!

## About Me

üë©‚Äçüíª I'm currently honing my skills in web development through a FullStack Bootcamp at [Factoria F5](https://factoriaf5.org/).

üé® My journey in design started in 2010 as a hobby, gradually transitioning into a career. Since 2017, I've been immersed in the world of UX/UI design, constantly striving for excellence and innovation.

üå± Always eager to learn and grow, I'm fluent in Figma for design and currently expanding my expertise in web development technologies.

üåç Originally from Ukraine, I'm now enjoying life in beautiful Asturias, Spain. I'm multilingual, proficient in Ukrainian, Russian, English, and I'm steadily improving my Spanish skills.
